# UTM Links – Usage Guide for embersurrogacy.com

This doc is the detailed implementation guide for UTM tracking on the Ember Surrogacy site. The site is a hash SPA (`#/home`, `#/parents`, `#/surrogates`, `#/contact`, `#/apply`).

## How Tracking Works (code: `index.html:1239-1377`)

- **Parsing:** UTMs are parsed from BOTH `?utm_...` AND `#/page?utm_...` (`index.html:1244-1258`). Hash-router compatible.
- **Keys tracked (`index.html:1241`):** `utm_source`, `utm_medium`, `utm_campaign`, `utm_term`, `utm_content`, `utm_id`, plus auto-click IDs `gclid` (Google), `fbclid`/`fbadid` (Meta), `msclkid` (Bing), `gbraid`/`wbraid`.
- **Persistence:** Stored as `ember_utms_v1` in both `localStorage` + `sessionStorage`, survives SPA navigation `hashchange` / `popstate` (`index.html:1365-1366`).
- **Form injection:** Injected as hidden inputs (`data-utm`) into `contactForm` (Intended Parents) + `quizForm` (Surrogate quiz) (`index.html:1340-1356`).
- **Email:** Formatted into `MARKETING ATTRIBUTION` block in StaticForms email (`index.html:1300-1338`).
- **GA4:** Sent with every SPA `page_view` via `gtag('event', 'page_view', { ...utms })` (`index.html:1404-1409`).
- **First-touch context:** Also captures `_first_landing`, `_first_referrer`, `_first_seen` on first visit (`index.html:1285-1288`).

## Link Format (hash-router compatible)

```
https://embersurrogacy.com/#/<route>?utm_source=<source>&utm_medium=<medium>&utm_campaign=<campaign>&utm_content=<variant>
# OR top-level search (also works)
https://embersurrogacy.com/?utm_source=<source>&utm_medium=<medium>&utm_campaign=<campaign>#/<route>
```

**Naming Rules:** lowercase, `_` or `+` separated, no spaces. Keep `utm_campaign` specific enough to split Parents vs. Surrogates funnels — it flows straight into the StaticForms email `info@embersurrogacy.com` receives.

### Quick-Build Cheat Sheet

| Param | Use for Ember | Example values |
|-------|---------------|----------------|
| `utm_source` | Platform / publisher | `instagram`, `facebook`, `google`, `linkedin`, `newsletter`, `podcast`, `referral_partner`, `ccrm` |

---

## 1. Instagram
Use `medium` to distinguish surface; `content` to tag post/reel/story variant so you know what creative drove the lead to `#/apply` vs `#/parents`.

```
# Feed post -> Intended Parents page
https://embersurrogacy.com/#/parents?utm_source=instagram&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=parents_q3_2026&utm_content=feed_carousel_v1

# Reel from surrogate ambassador -> Surrogate quiz (high-intent)
https://embersurrogacy.com/#/apply?utm_source=instagram&utm_medium=social_reel&utm_campaign=surrogates_q3_2026&utm_content=ambassador_jess_reel2

# Stories swipe-up / link sticker -> Homepage with brand campaign
https://embersurrogacy.com/#/home?utm_source=instagram&utm_medium=social_stories&utm_campaign=brand_awareness_q3&utm_content=story_poll_v2

# Link in bio (Linktree/Beacons) - generic fallback
https://embersurrogacy.com/?utm_source=instagram&utm_medium=bio&utm_campaign=always_on&utm_content=link_in_bio#/
```

**Use case:** Compare which format converts better to surrogate applications vs. parent inquiries.

## 2. Facebook (Meta)
Same as IG but keep `source=facebook` so GA4 doesn't bundle them. `fbclid` is auto-captured if an ad click appends it.

```
# FB Page organic post -> Contact
https://embersurrogacy.com/#/contact?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=parents_q3_2026&utm_content=page_post_july18

# Paid Advantage+ campaign -> Parents (use utm_id for GA4 ↔ Ads linking)
https://embersurrogacy.com/#/parents?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=parents_search_2026&utm_content=adv_carousel_a&utm_id=12021345678

# FB Group share via community mod (track partner)
https://embersurrogacy.com/#/surrogates?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=surrogates_q3_2026&utm_content=group_surro_squad_mod
```

**Use case:** Separate organic community building from paid acquisition for ROAS reporting.

## 3. Google
`medium=cpc` for Ads, `organic` for SEO content, auto `gclid` capture for attribution. Use `utm_term` only on paid search.

```
# Google Ads - Intended Parents search - Cost page keyword
https://embersurrogacy.com/#/parents?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=parents_q3_search&utm_term=surrogacy+agency+cost&utm_content=rsa_headline_a

# Google Ads - Surrogate acquisition
https://embersurrogacy.com/#/apply?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=surrogates_q3_search&utm_term=become+a+surrogate&utm_content=rsa_headline_pay_comp

# Organic blog/press link back to site (you publish a guest post)
https://embersurrogacy.com/#/about?utm_source=google&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=seo_guest_post&utm_content=parents_com_article

# Google Business Profile website button
https://embersurrogacy.com/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gbp_website_btn&utm_content=profile_mainlink#/
```

**Use case:** Measure true paid keyword performance for two different personas (parents vs surrogates) — they have very different CPCs and LTVs.

## 4. LinkedIn
Primary B2B — referral partners (IVF clinics, attorneys), founder thought-leadership. Keep `source=linkedin`.

```
# Founder personal post -> Parents landing
https://embersurrogacy.com/#/parents?utm_source=linkedin&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=parents_q3_2026&utm_content=founder_post_july_era_v2

# Company page - Surrogates hiring angle
https://embersurrogacy.com/#/surrogates?utm_source=linkedin&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=surrogates_q3_2026&utm_content=company_page_mission_video

# LinkedIn Ads - IVF Clinic referral partner campaign (high value)
https://embersurrogacy.com/#/contact?utm_source=linkedin&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=referral_ivf_q3_2026&utm_content=sponsored_inmail_clinic_v1&utm_id=linkedin_clinic_01

# Direct outreach to attorney partner network
https://embersurrogacy.com/#/home?utm_source=linkedin&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=attorney_partners_q3&utm_content=dm_jody_template
```

**Use case:** Track which referral partner channel converts to qualified parent leads. LinkedIn outreach is high-intent for Ember's B2B2C model.

## 5. Newsletter / Email

```
https://embersurrogacy.com/#/parents?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=parents_nurture_q3&utm_content=weekly_jul21_cta
https://embersurrogacy.com/#/apply?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=surrogates_drip_02&utm_content=comp_breakdown_btn
```

**Use case:** Drip attribution — know which email in a nurture sequence drove the second-touch application.

## 6. Podcast / PR / Speaking

```
https://embersurrogacy.com/?utm_source=podcast&utm_medium=podcast&utm_campaign=brand_q3&utm_content=podcast_infertility_untold_2026_07#/
```

**Use case:** Vanity URL alternative — give podcast hosts a trackable link that doesn't look like a shortener and still surfaces in GA4.

## 7. Referral Partner (IVF clinics, attorneys)

```
https://embersurrogacy.com/#/contact?utm_source=ccrm&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=ivf_referral_q3_2026&utm_content=qr_lobby_card
https://embersurrogacy.com/#/apply?utm_source=referral_partner&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=surrogates_local_q3&utm_content=clinic_xyz_flyer
```

**Use case:** Physical / offline attribution. One `utm_source` per clinic (`ccrm`, `shady_grove`, `rma`) lets you calculate referral value per clinic partnership.

## 8. A/B Testing CTAs (on-site or across assets)
This architecture stores `_first_landing` + `_first_referrer` + `_first_seen` (index.html:1285-1288), so if a user lands via `?utm_source=instagram` on `#/home` and later navigates to `#/apply` and submits, attribution still shows Original Landing = Instagram. Use `utm_content` to differentiate which button drove it:

```
?utm_source=instagram&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=parents_q3_2026&utm_content=home_hero_cta
vs
?utm_source=instagram&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=parents_q3_2026&utm_content=footer_cta
```

**Use case:** Creative testing — which CTA placement / video variant drives form submits, even with multi-page SPA navigation.

## 9. Verification

Add debug flag and check email + GA4:

```
https://embersurrogacy.com/?utm_source=linkedin&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=test_q3&debug=1#/
```

Then navigate to `#/contact` or `#/apply` and submit a test. Check StaticForms email for `MARKETING ATTRIBUTION` block and GA4 → Reports → Traffic Acquisition for session source.

## 10. QR Codes
Reuse same UTM strings above — just encode the full URL into the QR via any generator. Use unique `utm_content=qr_lobby_card` vs `qr_event_banner` to tell apart scans. Example: clinic lobby card vs. conference booth banner both `source=ccrm` but different `content`.
